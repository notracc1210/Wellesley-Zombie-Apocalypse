# Wellesley-Zombie-Apocalypse
Upskill 2026 Project
Our team is creating a command-line choose-your-own-adventure game. In each round, users will roll the dice to determine their next location, and each location has its own event. At the end of the game, users will get different endings/achievements based on their final status (HP/Aggressiveness).
We use Java to build the game.
